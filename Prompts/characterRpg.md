The card should include the following elements: \n\n- A sleek and contemporary design with sharp, clean lines and a professional color scheme that suggests business acumen.\n- A high-quality image of a modern businessman in professional attire, such as a suit and tie, positioned prominently on the card.\n- Attribute categories relevant to a business context, such as 'Leadership', 'Negotiation', 'Innovation', 'Networking', and 'Presentation'.\n- Each attribute should have an associated value or rating that indicates the level of skill or proficiency.\n- The name of the character at the top of the card should be something indicative of success and professionalism, like "Mr. Sterling".\n- Include visual elements that suggest modernity and business, such as graphs or icons related to finance or technology.\n- The overall layout should be clean and organized, allowing for easy reading of attributes while still being visually engaging.
