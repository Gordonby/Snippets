# Azure AI Digital Avatar

The Microsoft Azure AI services host a text to speech capability. It can provide a digital avatar that will read and gesture to the content you provide. 

The format it requires is SSML, which is an XML based markup language.

There is a python sdk for this, but for low iterations of videos - Postman http calls make much more sense.
